The global Metal Clad Pipes market was valued at US$ million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ million by 2029, at a CAGR of % during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Clad pipes are special corrosion-resistant pipes made by bonding carbon steel pipes with corrosion resistant alloys (CRAs) to withstand highly corrosive environments. They are mostly used in the offshore oil & gas industry in high temperature and high pressure conditions as they exhibit high corrosion resistivity. Clad pipes are generally made by bonding a parent metal pipe, which is generally carbon steel, and a CRA metal pipe made of nickel and copper alloys.

One of the main factors associated with the prosperity of the clad pipe market is corrosion. Corrosion is a major problem in pipelines in the oil & gas industry as oil & gas products carry along various chemicals and gases that causes corrosion. This has compelled major oil & gas companies to opt for the installation of clad pipes as they are economical and corrosion resistant. This, coupled with the increasing number of offshore oil & gas projects, is expected to drive the clad pipe market over the forecast period.

The fabrication of clad pipes is difficult and requires specialized welding techniques. Clad pipes are also more expensive as compared to lined pipes, which may prove to be a challenge as it deters the adoption of clad pipes. However, given its advantages such as high corrosion resistivity, light weight and economic price point, the clad pipe market is expected to register robust growth over the forecast period.
